Plotly Assignment

Problem Statement:

Sam’s next exam is on the plotly package. The questions will be asked on the basis of what you’ve learnt in the respective module.
Questions:

1.	Build a histogram for the ‘tenure’ column.
> plot_ly(data=customer_churn, x=~tenure, type = "histogram")
 

a.	Color should be determined by ‘gender’ column
2.	> plot_ly(data=customer_churn, x=~tenure, type = "histogram", color=~gender)
3.	Warning messages:
4.	1: In RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(N, "Set2") :
5.	  minimal value for n is 3, returning requested palette with 3 different levels
6.	
7.	2: In RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(N, "Set2") :
8.	  minimal value for n is 3, returning requested palette with 3 different levels
 
b.Color should be determined by ‘PaymentMethod’ column
> plot_ly(data=customer_churn, x=~tenure, type = "histogram", color=~PaymentMethod)
 

9.	Create a scatter plot between ‘tenure’ & ‘MonthlyCharges’. Map ‘tenure’ on the y-axis & ‘MonthlyCharges’ on the ‘x-axis’
a.	Color should be determined by ‘InternetService’ column
10.	> plot_ly(data=customer_churn, y=~tenure, x=~MonthlyCharges, mode="marker", color=~InternetService )
11.	No trace type specified:
12.	  Based on info supplied, a 'scatter' trace seems appropriate.
13.	  Read more about this trace type -> https://plot.ly/r/reference/#scatter
 
b.	Color should be determined by ‘Contract’ column
c.	> plot_ly(data=customer_churn, y=~tenure, x=~MonthlyCharges, mode="marker", color=~Contract)
d.	No trace type specified:
e.	  Based on info supplied, a 'scatter' trace seems appropriate.
f.	  Read more about this trace type -> https://plot.ly/r/reference/#scatter
 


3.	Create a box-plot between ‘tenure’ & ‘MultipleLines’. Map ‘tenure’ on the y-axis & ‘MultipleLines’ on the x-axis
a.	Color should be determined by ‘Dependents’ column
4.	> plot_ly(data=customer_churn, y=~tenure, x=~MultipleLines, type="box", color = ~Dependents)
5.	Warning messages:
6.	1: In RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(N, "Set2") :
7.	  minimal value for n is 3, returning requested palette with 3 different levels
8.	
9.	2: In RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(N, "Set2") :
10.	  minimal value for n is 3, returning requested palette with 3 different levels
