geom_point() Function Assignment
Problem Statement:
Sam’s next exam is on ‘geom_point()’ function from the ggplot2 package. The questions will be asked on the basis of what you’ve learnt in the respective module.
Questions:
1. Build a scatter-plot between ‘TotalCharges’ & ‘tenure’. Map ‘TotalCharges’ to the y-axis &
‘tenure’ to the ‘x-axis’
a.	Assign it the color ‘wheat3’
b.	> ggplot(data=customer_churn, aes(y=TotalCharges, x=tenure))+geom_point(col='wheat3')
c.	Warning message:
d.	Removed 11 rows containing missing values (geom_point). 
 
b. Use ‘col’ as an aesthetic and Map ‘PaymentMethod’ to col
> ggplot(data=customer_churn, aes(y=TotalCharges, x=tenure, col=PaymentMethod))+geom_point()
Warning message:
Removed 11 rows containing missing values (geom_point). 
 
c. Use ‘col’ as an aesthetic and Map ‘gender’ to col
> ggplot(data=customer_churn, aes(y=TotalCharges, x=tenure, col=gender))+geom_point()
Warning message:
Removed 11 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
 
e.	Map ‘Dependents’ to both ‘col’ & ‘shape’ aesthetics
f.	> ggplot(data=customer_churn, aes(y=TotalCharges, x=tenure, col=Dependents, shape=Dependents))+geom_point()
g.	Warning message:
h.	Removed 11 rows containing missing values (geom_point). 
 
2. Build a scatter-plot between ‘tenure’ & ‘MonthlyCharges’. Map ‘tenure’ to the y-axis &
‘MonthlyCharges’ to the ‘x-axis’
a.	Assign it the color ‘yellowgreen’
b.	> ggplot(data=customer_churn, aes(y=tenure, x=MonthlyCharges))+geom_point(col='yellowgreen')
 
c.	Use ‘col’ as an aesthetic and Map ‘InternetService’ to col
d.	> ggplot(data=customer_churn, aes(y=tenure, x=MonthlyCharges, col=InternetService))+geom_point()
 
c. Use ‘col’ as an aesthetic and Map ‘Contract’ to col
> ggplot(data=customer_churn, aes(y=tenure, x=MonthlyCharges, col=Contract))+geom_point()
